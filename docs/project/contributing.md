title: How To Contribute
---

Thank you for being interested in helping out the project! We can never finish this without a lot of help from fans.

## What kinds of things do we need?

There are a number of different roles that we will need on the team. Depending on the current state of the project, we may need different numbers of people
in each role. Here are the different roles that we need:

### Patch Development

At the core of this project is the code changes we need to make to the underlying game. We have developed some tools and have code to do the basics, but there will likely need to be more work before we're done.

### Platform Development

In addition to the patch itself, we will need tools to be able to build the patch, and to apply the patch on client computers.

### Voice Actors

If we're going to add voices to Space Quest 5, naturally we're going to need people to provide them.

### Voice Directors

While the voice actors can give good performances, that's nothing if we can't have someone to help make it all work. These people will be part of group sessions, helping people figure out the best way to deliver their lines.

### Audio Editing

Once we have the voice samples, we need someone to make it ready to be put into the game. This includes being able to clean up the samples, make them match each other, and make sure it sounds good in the game itself.

### Site Editor

If you've looked around this site and said: "Geez, this is a mess", then you know why we need this. The responsibilities here will be to keep the site up to date and create content to help new visitors.

### Media/Marketing Manager

We will need to have a public face to the project in order to get some buzz going for the project as we approach completion. This includes managing any public social media accounts. We will also need to work on some kind of "advertisement" materials, such as trailers and announcements.

## Okay, but how can I help?

If you're interested in helping, please submit your interest through our contribution form. This will let us know what roles you're interested in, what skills you may have, and how much time you want to contribute. We are all volunteers here, so we don't expect this to be a full-time job for anyone.
