## What is this?

*Space Quest 5: Re-Mutilated* is a project to add voice acting to *Space Quest 5: The Next Mutation*, published in 1993 by Sierra On-Line.

If you don't know what Space Quest 5 is, it was an adventure game in the long running Space Quest series of games that were loving parodies of all things science fiction. You should play them.

If you don't know what an adventure game is, it is a genre of video game where you take the role of one or more characters and try to solve their problems through puzzles mostly coming from the clever application of items and dialogue through a point-and-click interface. This is as opposed to the genre where you take the role of one or more characters to solve their problems through puzzles mostly coming from the clever application of sharp things on the fleshy bits of things they don't like.

If you don't know what a video game is, it is a type of computer program that humans derive entertainment from through using input devices like a keyboard, mouse, or controller, usually resulting through visual or auditory stimulation through specially designed output devices. It is one of the most successful types of media in the world at the moment, and has been blamed for a great proportion of the world's problems.

If you don't know what a computer program is, then I'm not sure how you're reading this.

## Why would you want to do this?

Well, to start with, we're insane.

Second, in an odd turn of fate, both the previous game in the series (Space Quest 4) and the sequel to this game (Space Quest 6) ended up getting voiced versions, however Space Quest 5 never got its due. We want to change this, making something that can hopefully hold up to those performances without fundamentally changing the game we love.

Finally, we're still insane.

## How does this work?

This project will release a small patch to the existing game which includes small engine changes to allow for voices, along with data containing all of our vocal performances. With a very simple patching process, players will be able to add the files to the existing game and play it with the ScummVM engine.

## Where can I get it?

Well, we don't really have everything done yet. Eventually you will be able to get it straight from this site, but there are a lot of steps to do before we're done.

## When will it be released?

We will update this as we know now. We're hoping to finish it by early 2026, but we're all volunteers here, so schedules tend to be... flexible.

## How can I help?

Take a look at the [Contributing](./project/contributing.md) page if you want to help out.

## Is this an official project?

HAHAHAHA! HAhaHAhahahaHA! Oh man, that's rich.

No. No, not in the slightest. We are simply a group of fans of the game that want to see this done.
